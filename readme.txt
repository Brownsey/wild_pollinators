For all the code and produced documents for the dissertation see: https://github.com/Brownsey/wild_pollinators
The code files included in this zip submission are the main rmarkdown files used for the analysis undertaken and the code required to build the shiny application.
All the code can be run in R and will produce a pdf output of the analysis once run.
There are two exploratory analysis files: exploratory_rmd.rmd, botanist_EDA.rmd
There is one clustering analysis file: clustering.rmd
There is one shiny application file: app.R, Rdata file: shinydata.RData
Note to run the shiny application locally - Rdata file must also be in the local area, but the application can be viewed online at: https://brownsey.shinyapps.io/shinyapp/
The main findings from the analysis are demonstrated in the application.
